# FreeCodeCamp
Using Free Code camp to learn Node JS, with the cloud 9 terminal
## So far I enjoy free code camp.
I have been teaching myself how to program for close to two years.
I have realised that with many free tutorials on the web, you'll often find yourself simply copying code.
Which is great but I don't feel you learn as much.
FreeCodeCamp gives you a problem and a hint and lets you solve that problem.  You'll find yourself reading more technical docs which is a better way to learn in my opinion.
